    "- This example code utilizes the Crew AI framework to demonstrate multi-agent collaboration using Google Gemini. \n",
    "- It defines two distinct agents: a 'Senior Research Analyst' tasked with finding and summarizing AI trends, and a 'Technical Content Writer' responsible for creating a blog post. \n",
    "- Two tasks are set up, with the research task assigned to the researcher and the writing task assigned to the writer. Crucially, the writing task is configured to use the output of the research task as its context, establishing a sequential workflow. \n",
    "- A Crew is then instantiated with these agents and tasks, specifying a sequential process. Finally, crew.kickoff() executes the defined workflow, allowing the agents to collaborate by passing information from research to writing to produce the final blog post.\n",
