    "- For times when you need to do more complex things – like updating several keys at once, saving things that aren't just text, targeting specific scopes like user: or app:, or making updates that aren't tied to the agent's final text reply – you'll manually build a dictionary of your state changes (the state_delta) and include it within the EventActions of the Event you're appending.\n",
