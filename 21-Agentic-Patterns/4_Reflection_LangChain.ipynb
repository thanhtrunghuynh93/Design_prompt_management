    "# 4 - Reflection\n",
    "- We can demonstrate the core idea of a single reflection step within a LangChain chain using LCEL. This example will show how to generate an initial output, use an LLM to critique.\n",
    "- While full iterative reflection often requires stateful workflows (like LangGraph), a single reflection step can be implemented in LangChain using LCEL to pass output for critique and subsequent refinement. "
